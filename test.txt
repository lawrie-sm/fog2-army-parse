IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ACHAEMENID1, "Between 550 and 500 BC, the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia conquered the Median, Lydian and Babylonian empires, Egypt and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, thus forming the largest empire the world had yet known, stretching from the Bosporus to western India. Their next target was mainland Greece. The Early Achaemenid Persian army consisted mainly of archers, on horse and on foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ACHAEMENID2, "Following the failure of their invasions of Greece, the Achaemenid Empire fell back on the defensive. At first, they continued to rely on massed foot and horse archers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ACHAEMENID3, "Following the failure of their invasions of Greece, the Achaemenid Empire fell back on the defensive. Some time later they abandoned their system of massed archery, replacing their battle-line foot with Greek mercenary hoplites and re-arming most of their cavalry with spears. In 334 BC Alexander the Great of Macedon invaded and within five years had conquered the once mighty empire.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ANCIENT_BRITISH, "The Ancient British tribes at the time of Julius Caesar's British expeditions of 55 and 54 BC, and Claudius's successful invasion of 43 AD, were somewhat behind the times compared with their Gallic cousins. They still made much use of chariots and massed slingers. In addition they had the usual infantry warbands, plus light horse.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ANGLOSAXON, "Jutes, Angles and Saxons began to settle in SE Britain from the middle of the 5th century AD. In this period they fought entirely on foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ANTIGONOS, "Following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. After the initial round of wars, Antigonos I Monophthalmos held the centre of the empire, Asia Minor, and seemed the most powerful of the successors. This provoked the others to form a grand alliance against him. In 301 BC he was killed by the combined armies of Lysimachos and Seleukos at the Battle of Ipsus in Phrygia. The Antigonid army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_APULIAN, "The armies of Apulia in southern Italy consisted of javelin-armed infantry and high quality cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ARAB, "This list covers the tribal forces of Arabia outside the Nabataean Kingdom.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ARMENIAN, "The mountainous kingdom of Armenia maintained a precarious independence through most of this era. During the reign of Tigranes the Great in the first century BC it conquered a short-lived empire, but the Romans soon put paid to that. The core of the Armenian army consisted of armoured cataphracts on armoured horses. These were supported by large numbers of unarmoured horse archers and lightly equipped foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ARMENIAN2, "The mountainous kingdom of Armenia maintained a precarious independence through most of this era. In the 3rd century AD, under Sassanid Persian influence, the Armenian heavy cavalry probably converted to Sassanid-style armoured horse archers. These were supported by unarmoured horse archers and lightly equipped foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ATROPATENE, "The northern part of Media, in modern Iran and Azerbaijan, seceded from the Seleucid kingdom circa 320 BC, becoming the kingdom of Atropatene. This maintained a precarious independence until briefly annexed to Tigranes the Great of Armenia's short-lived empire in the second quarter of the 1st century BC, and thereafter became a vassal of the Parthian empire.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_BITHYNIAN, "The small Thracian kingdom of Bithynia in the NW corner of Asia Minor maintained an independent existence from 297 BC until 74 BC when the last king bequeathed his kingdom to Rome.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_BOSPORAN, "The Bosporan kingdom, ruled initially by the Hellenized Thracian Spartokid dynasty, and subsequently by Mithridates VI of Pontus and his descendants, latterly as clients of Rome, was based around the Greek colonies of the Crimean and Taman peninsulas north of the Black Sea. Its armies consisted of a mix of mercenaries, local militia, and nobles equipped as Sarmatian-style lancers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_BRUTTIAN, "The Oscan-controlled regions of Bruttia and Lucania in southern Italy allied with Hannibal during the Second Punic War. Their armies consisted mainly of javelin-armed foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_CALEDONIAN, "The Caledonians were similar to the southern Britons but mostly fielded infantry warbands with a few chariots.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_CAMPANIAN, "Following the Oscan conquest of Greek Campania in southern Italy in the late 5th century BC, Campanian armies consisted of a mixture of hoplites and Oscan javelin-armed foot. Campania was subjected to Rome in 340 BC, but rebelled and allied with Hannibal during the Second Punic War.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_CARTHAGINIAN, "The North African city of Carthage, now a suburb of Tunis, was a colony of the Phoenician city of Tyre. Carthage expanded in the centuries preceding this era to create a large mercantile empire in the southern Mediterranean and Spain. Rome's greatest opponent, from 264 BC Carthage fought a series of epic wars against the Romans, ultimately being destroyed by them in 146 BC. The Carthaginian army mostly consisted of an eclectic mixture of mercenaries from all over the western Mediterranean.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_CARTHAGINIAN0, "The North African city of Carthage, now a suburb of Tunis, was a colony of the Phoenician city of Tyre. Carthage expanded to create a large mercantile empire in the southern Mediterranean and Spain. Prior to coming into conflict with Rome in 264 BC, Carthage's main opponents were the Greek cities of Sicily. The Carthaginian army mostly consisted of an eclectic mixture of mercenaries from all over the western Mediterranean.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_CAUCASIAN, "This list covers the Albanians and other non-Georgian peoples of the Caucasus.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_DACIAN, "The Dacians were the descendants of the earlier Thracians, living in an area of Eastern Europe centred around modern Romania. In the late first and early second century AD the Romans fought a series of wars against them, eventually making the southern half of Dacia into a Roman province. This was abandoned again in the late third century. Like their Thracian ancestors, Dacian armies included men armed with the dreaded falx, a curved blade with the cutting edge on the inside of the curve, on the end of a long handle, capable of lopping off limbs. Dacian armies could also include allied Sarmatian lancers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ETRUSCAN,"The origin of the powerful Etruscan civilisation in northern and central Italy is uncertain. In the late 4th century BC it came into conflict with the nascent power of Rome, and was eventually overwhelmed. Its army, at least until influenced by Rome, consisted principally of hoplite-style spearmen, supported by cavalry and skirmishers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ETRUSCAN2,"The origin of the powerful Etruscan civilisation in northern and central Italy is uncertain. In the late 4th century BC it came into conflict with the nascent power of Rome, and was eventually overwhelmed. Its army, at least until influenced by Rome, consisted principally of hoplite-style spearmen, supported by cavalry and skirmishers. Some time after Rome re-organised its infantry to fight with pilum and sword, the Etruscans probably began to follow suit.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_E_GALLIC, "The Celtic tribes of Gaul (modern France) and northern Italy were fierce warriors. They inflicted several humiliating defeats on the Romans, and sacked Rome in 387 BC. At this time Gallic armies consisted of fierce foot warbands, sometimes supported by chariots.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GALATIAN, "The Galatians originated as several Celtic tribes who invaded Greece in 281 BC. They were eventually repelled, but meanwhile three tribes split off from the main horde and invaded Asia Minor. There they proved impossible to dislodge and formed a new Galatian state in the central plateau. With a reputation for exceptional ferocity, they were much in demand as mercenaries by the Hellenistic kingdoms. Their armies consisted of foot warbands and cavalry, though they did make use of scythed and non-scythed chariots on occasion. Galatia was eventually peacefully incorporated into the Roman Empire in 25 BC, their imitation legions being directly adopted into the Roman army.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GALLIC, "The Celtic tribes of Gaul (modern France) and northern Italy were fierce warriors. Prior to this era they inflicted several humiliating defeats on the Romans, and sacked Rome in 387 BC. Several Gallic tribes joined Hannibal in his invasion of Italy in the Second Punic War. Following the defeat of Carthage, the Romans steadily conquered the Gallic tribes in Italy and southern Gaul. From 58 to 50 BC the rest of Gaul was conquered by Julius Caesar. Gallic armies consisted of foot warbands and excellent cavalry. Chariots were already becoming obsolete by the start of our era, and were no longer in use by the time of Caesar's Gallic War.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GERMANIC_FOOT, "The Germanic tribes first came into conflict with Rome in 113 BC. Thereafter they became a major concern of Roman foreign policy right through until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. They included, amongst many others, the Cimbri, Teutones, Marcomanni, Alamanni, Franks, Burgundi, Visigoths and early Vandals. Their main strength was in their infantry warbands, supplemented by small numbers of cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GERMANIC_HORSE, "In the third century AD some of the eastern Germanic tribes began to adopt Sarmatian style tactics, converting their cavalry into charging lancers and vastly increasing their numbers. Along with the Germanic foot tribes, these tribes made a major contribution to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Amongst others, they included the Ostrogoths, Gepids and later Vandals.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GRAECO_BACTRIAN, "The Graeco-Bactrian kingdom, north-west of India, was founded by Diodotos I when as governor of Bactria he seceded from the Seleucid Empire circa 250 BC. Subsequent Seleucid attempts at reconquest were repelled, and the kingdom expanded into India. The army had a core of Hellenistic troops, but its main strength was the Bactrian cavalry, armoured lancers and unarmoured horse archers. The kingdom eventually fell to the nomadic Yuezhi circa 130 BC.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GREEK1, "The city states of Greece were at constant war with each other. Their armies were based on the phalanx of hoplite spearmen, equipped with spear, large shield, helmet, greaves and metal or fabric armour. The most militaristic Greek state, Sparta, had the most feared and respected hoplites.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_GREEK2, "In the third century BC the Greek city states began to replace their traditional hoplites, first with the more lightly equipped thureophoroi and later with a Macedonian-style pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_HEPHTHALITE, "The Hephthalites were a nomadic confederation who invaded the eastern provinces of the Sassanid Empire in the fifth century AD and conquered their own empire in southern Central Asia and India. Their forces included numerous horse archers plus Indian troops including elephants.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_IBERIAN, "The Iberian and Colchian kingdoms were early Georgian states. Not much is known about their armies, but it is believed that the Iberians at least used a combination of Sarmatian-style lancers and infantry with javelins.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ILLYRIAN, "The ancient Illyrians, living in the mountainous regions east of the Adriatic Sea, were at constant war with each other as well as raiding the neighbouring nations. In equipment and fighting style they more or less corresponded to the thureophoroi spearmen fielded by the Hellenistic nations. They were unusual in that their slaves fought alongside the free tribesmen. Most of the region was annexed as a Roman province in 167 BC.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_INDIAN, "Indian armies of the classical period were based on a fourfold division into infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants, in order of increasing prestige. Most of the numerous infantry were archers, though some were armed with javelins and shields.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_INDOPARTHIAN, "About the middle of the 1st century BC the Surens invaded the Indus Valley, conquering the last Indo-Greek principalities and breaking the power of the Sakas. Suren supremacy in NW India lasted until the Kushan invasion in the 1st century AD.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_INDOSKYTHIAN, "Driven south by the advancing Yuezhi at the start of the 1st century BC, the Saka migrated south into India where they rapidly conquered a large swathe of territory. In the 1st century AD they were in turn replaced or vassalized by the Yuezhi Kushans.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_INDO_GREEK, "The Indo-Greek kingdoms were formed when the Graeco-Bactrian king Demetrios I invaded India circa 180 BC. The Indo-Greek territories soon broke up into a number of independent kingdoms. The last of these fell to the Yuezhi circa 10 AD. Indo-Greek armies included Hellenistic and Indian troops.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ITALIAN_HILL, "Italian hill tribes included the Aequi, Aurunci, Hernici, Picentes, Sabines, Sidicini and Volsci. The last of them were conquered by Rome in the early 3rd century BC. Their armies consisted mainly of javelin-armed foot.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_JEWISH, "In 167 BC the Jews of Judaea revolted against the Seleucid kingdom. A successful guerrilla war led to Judaean independence under the Hasmonean dynasty. Initially its army was (at least in theory) modelled on the Hellenistic system � but whether this went as far as fielding a pike phalanx is unknown. In 63 BC Judaea became a protectorate of Rome, with a Roman governor but a local king - initially Hasmonean but replaced by the Idumaean Herodian dynasty in 37 BC. The army then probably came to include imitation legions. In 6 AD the region came under direct Roman rule. Between 66 and 136 AD there were three major Jewish revolts that were harshly suppressed by the Romans, eventually leading to the scattering of the Jewish population around the known world.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_KAPPADOKIAN, "The small kingdom of Kappadokia in east central Asia Minor secured its independence from the Seleucid kingdom circa 260 BC and remained independent, apart from brief periods of occupation by Mithridates VI of Pontus, until it was converted from a client kingdom to a Roman province in 17 AD. Its army consisted of lightly equipped infantry and excellent cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_KUSHAN, "The Yuezhi conquered the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom circa 130 BC, although the Kushan Empire was not founded until 30 BC when the Kushan tribe gained supremacy over the other Yuezhi tribes. The empire then expanded into India, annexing the Indo-Greek and many native kingdoms. The Kushan Empire and its successor states survived until the late 5th century when they were overcome by the Hephthalite Huns and the rise of the Gupta Empire. The Kushan army consisted of unarmoured horse archers and fully armoured cataphracts, supported by elephants and other Indian levies.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_KYRENE, "Kyrene was the oldest and most important of several Greek colonies on the coast of Libya. The main difference between Kyrenean and mainland Greek armies was the use of 3-man 4-horse chariots. Kyrene was annexed by the Ptolemaic kingdom circa 322 BC.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_LATIN, "The Latin League comprised the cities of Latium near Rome. Like the Romans at this time, the Latins fought as hoplites. They were allied with Rome from 493 BC. However, over the following 150 years, Rome gradually came to dominate the League. This eventually led to rebellion in the Latin War of 340-338 BC. Following their defeat in this war, the Latin towns were directly ruled from Rome.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_LIBYAN, "The independent Libyan tribes between Carthage and Egypt mostly relied on javelin armed infantry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_LIGURIAN, "Once occupying much of NW Italy and SE France, by this period the Ligurians were largely confined to the hills of modern Liguria and Piedmont. They fought almost entirely on foot, with javelins.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_LYDIAN, "The kingdom of Lydia in western Asia Minor had prospered for several centuries and was in the processing of expanding to create an empire when it came into conflict with the expanding Persian Empire. This resulted in defeat and annexation. The Lydian army was built around a core of armoured hoplites and high quality spear-armed cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_LYSIMACHID, "Following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. Lysimachos, governor of Thrace, later claimed the title of King. Together with Seleukos I, he defeated Antigonos I and gained control of western Asia Minor in the division of the spoils. He subsequently also seized Macedon. Eventually he fell out with Seleukos and was killed at the Battle of Corupedion. The Lysimachid army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_MACEDON1, "Under King Philip II, the Macedonian army was enlarged and reorganised. Instead of hoplites the infantry were equipped with a long pike wielded in both hands. This would easily outreach the hoplite spear, and allowed five ranks of pike heads to project beyond the front rank men. The cavalry were reorganised too, as lancers. With this army he seized hegemony over Greece. His son, Alexander the Great, invaded the Persian Empire in 334 and had conquered it by 329. He then marched on into India, before dying on the way back to Europe in 323.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_MACEDON2, "On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. After changing hands several times, Alexander's original kingdom of Macedon, north of Greece, was finally secured by the Antigonid dynasty. The Antigonid kingdom lasted until 148 BC. Macedon was annexed by the Romans in 146 BC. The Macedonian army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.", 
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_MOUNTAIN_INDIAN, "This covers the tribes of the NW mountain border of India, who fought in a different style to the lowland Indians.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_NABATAEAN, "The Arab Nabataean kingdom in northern Arabia arose in the late 4th century BC and survived as an independent state until it was annexed by the Romans in 106 AD. Its capital, Petra, remains one of the wonders of the world. It armies were largely based on horse and foot archers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_NUMIDIAN, "The Numidian and Moorish kingdoms of western North Africa were under Carthaginian influence prior to the fall of Carthage. From 112 BC they came into conflict with Rome. Numidia was annexed by Rome in 25 BC and Mauretania in 44 AD. Numidian and Moorish armies mainly consisted of unarmoured light horse and foot javelinmen. At various times they attempted to imitate Roman legions.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PALMYRAN, "In 260 AD the Sassanian King Shapur I defeated the Romans at the Battle of Edessa, capturing the Emperor Valerian and subsequently using him as a mounting block. Odenathus, ruler of the rich trading city of Palmyra (Tadmor in modern Syria), successfully campaigned against Shapur on behalf of the Romans for several years. When he was assassinated in 267, however, his wife Queen Zenobia annexed Roman Arabia and Egypt. In 272 the Emperor Aurelian defeated the Palmyrans and restored the eastern provinces to the Empire. The Palmyran army had a core of cataphract lancers, supported by large numbers of unarmoured horse and foot archers. Under Odenathus, it also included local Roman units.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PARTHIAN, "The Parthian Empire was founded by Arsaces I who, as leader of the nomadic Parni tribe, conquered the Seleucid province of Parthia in 247 BC while it was in revolt.  From there the Parthians steadily expanded at the expense of the Seleucid kingdom until they became neighbours of the Roman Empire following the Roman annexation of the remnants of the Seleucid kingdom in 63 BC. They inflicted their first defeat on an invading Roman army at Carrhae in 53 BC, and thereafter repelled multiple Roman invasions until they fell to the army of their Sassanid vassals in 224 AD. The Parthian army mainly consisted of unarmoured horse archers, supported by fully armoured cataphract lancers and sometimes infantry levies.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PERGAMENE, "The kingdom of Pergamum, in western Asia Minor, became independent under the Attalid dynasty following the defeat and death of Lysimachos in 281 BC.  From 214 BC Pergamum became Rome's staunchest ally, and gained large swathes of new territory after helping the Romans to defeat Anctiochos III of the Seleucid kingdom at Magnesia in 190 BC.  The kingdom was eventually bequeathed to Rome by Attalus III in 133 BC. Prior to gaining access to military colonies post-Magnesia, the Pergamene army lacked a pike phalanx, relying instead on thureophoroi, Galatian mercenaries and excellent lancers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PICTISH, "Picti (meaning 'painted' or 'tattooed') was the Roman name for the inhabitants of Scotland from the third century AD. Their infantry carried small shields and fought with spears.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PONTIC, "Pontus was a small Hellenistic kingdom south of the eastern Black Sea which secured its independence during the wars of the diadochi circa 281 BC. From 115 BC, under the rule of Mithridates VI, it began to expand, taking control of the Bosporan Kingdom in the Crimea. When Mithridates began to encroach on his neighbours in Asia Minor, he was forced to withdraw by decree of the Roman senate. Open war broke out in 88 BC, when an attempted invasion of Pontus by local Roman and allied forces was soundly defeated, and the victorious Pontic armies went on to annexe the whole of Asia Minor and advance into Greece. There, however, they were defeated by the Romans, and Mithridates was forced to withdraw and accept peace. Two more Mithridatic wars followed, Mithridates eventually fleeing to the Bosporus where he committed suicide when his son Pharnaces staged a coup in 63 BC. Pharnaces attempted to regain Pontus during the Roman Civil War, but was defeated by Caesar at Zela in 47 BC. The Pontic army consisted of a mix of local Hellenistic and Iranian troops, supplemented by mercenaries from many of the surrounding tribes. After his initial defeats, Mithridates reorganised his infantry as imitation legions.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_POTLUCK, "A random army list will be selected. This will be in keeping with the date and geographical location of the opposing army.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PTOLEMAIC, "On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. When the dust settled, Ptolemy held Egypt. The Ptolemaic kingdom lasted until it was annexed by the Romans in 30 BC following the defeat of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. The Ptolemaic army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_PYRRHIC, "Pyrrhos of Epeiros, one of history's Great Captains, had a meteoric career, which, however, led to no lasting success. Epeiros was a small kingdom located in modern north-west Greece and Albania. Yet, through his genius, Pyrrhos was able to contend on equal terms with Rome, Carthage and the other Macedonian successors, fighting wars in Italy, Sicily and Greece. He was killed by a thrown roof-tile during street-fighting in the Greek city of Argos. The Pyrrhic army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN0, "The Romans threw off their monarchy circa 509 BC. Prior to the end of the 1st Samnite War in 341 BC , Roman infantry fought as a hoplite phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN00, "Following the 1st Samnite War, the Romans re-equipped most of their infantry with heavy javelin (pilum) instead of thrusting spear. Each legion was usually deployed in a four line chequerboard formation, with light infantry (leves) in front and then three lines of heavy infantry, the hastati, principes and triarii. The hastati and principes were armed with pilum and sword, the veteran triarii with spear. Each legion also had a small body of attached cavalry. During this period the Romans expanded their control over central Italy.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN1, "During the period from 280 to 106 BC the Romans conquered much of their future empire. The legions were organised into maniples of 120 men. Each legion was usually deployed in a four line chequerboard formation, with light infantry (leves or velites) in front and then three lines of heavy infantry, the hastati, principes and triarii. The hastati and principes were armed with pilum and sword, the veteran triarii with spear. Each legion also had a small body of attached cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN2, "From 107 BC the Roman general Gaius Marius undertook a major reform of the Roman army. No longer were the legions divided into 120-men maniples, but into cohorts of 480 men. These still formed up in a chequerboard formation. All of the legionaries were now equipped the same, with pilum and sword. Light troops and cavalry were no longer supplied by the legions, but by allied or subject nations. This army continued the expansion of the Roman state almost to its final boundaries, before that state dissolved into a series of civil wars that would end with Octavius becoming the first emperor of the Roman Empire under the name of Augustus.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN3, "Under Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, the Roman army was reorganised. In addition to the legions, there were now regular auxiliary infantry and cavalry units recruited from the non-citizens of the provinces. Future expansion of the empire was relatively minor and not always long-lasting.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN4, "At the end of the third century AD there was another major military reorganisation of the Roman Empire. Instead of the army being almost entirely deployed on the frontiers, grand strategy turned to defence in depth, with the formation of mobile field armies able to travel rapidly to repel any barbarian incursion. Field army legions were much smaller than the original legions and were accompanied by elite auxilia palatina units and cavalry. The emphasis became more on defence than attack. Infantry were equipped with lighter javelins and lead-weighted throwing darts, as well as each unit being supported by its own integral archers. Cavalry now included fully-armoured cataphracts, especially in the east.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN4A, "Following the disastrous Roman defeat by the Goths at Adrianopolis in 378 AD, large numbers of Goths and other Germanic tribesmen were recruited into the Eastern Roman army to make up the numbers. Some also served as foederati, often for a single campaign, fighting in their native style.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_ROMAN5, "By the second quarter of the fifth century AD the regular Roman army was much depleted. The shortfall was made up by foederati recruited from the barbarian tribes who were wandering through the territories of the Empire. In 476 the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire was deposed by his foederati. The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, however, with its capital at Constantinople, rallied and recovered, and did not fall until Constantinople was captured by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SAMNITE, "Rome's greatest Italian foes, the fierce Samnites fought a series of wars against Rome from 343 to 272 BC. Their infantry were organised into legions and cohorts, but were more lightly equipped than the Romans and did not use a triple-line system.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SARMATIAN, "The Sarmatian tribes that replaced the Skythians in the western steppes were more heavily equipped. Some tribes, such as the Iazygians, fielded massed armoured lancers on non-metallic-armoured horses. Other tribes had a core of such lancers but also fielded large numbers of more lightly-equipped cavalry - with bow and spear in the case of the early Rhoxolani and with bow in the case of the Alans. The charge of the Sarmatian lancers was much feared, though steady Roman infantry could repel them.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SASSANID, "In 224 AD the Persians under the Sassanian Ardashir I overthrew their Parthian overlords and took over the Parthian Empire. They were much more aggressive than the Parthians and the eastern border of the Roman Empire became a much more dangerous place. Sassanid armies included some cataphracts and elephants, but their main strength was in their armoured horse archers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SCOTS_IRISH, "Scotti was the Roman name for the Irish. The Irish forces that fought amongst themselves in Ireland and raided Britain were mostly very lightly equipped javelinmen with a few chariots. They did not start colonising western Scotland until the end of this era.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SELEUCID1, "On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. When the dust settled, Seleukos held the bulk of the former Persian Empire except Egypt, his kingdom stretching from the Eastern Aegean to India. The Seleucid kingdom lasted until 63 BC when its last bastion, Syria, was made into a Roman province. The Seleucid army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SELEUCID2, "On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals began to fight over his empire. When the dust settled, Seleukos held the bulk of the former Persian Empire except Egypt, his kingdom stretching from the Eastern Aegean to India. The Seleucid kingdom lasted until 63 BC when its last bastion, Syria, was made into a Roman province. The Seleucid army was a typical Hellenistic army, based on the pike phalanx. After 205 BC the lancers were reorganised as fully armoured cataphracts on armoured horses.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SKYTHIAN, "The nomadic Skythian and Saka tribes ruled the steppes at the beginning of this era. Their periodic raids and invasions were much feared. Their armies were composed primarily of unarmoured horse archers with a core of more heavily armed nobility. When any enemy attempted punitive action against them they simply retreated into the steppes until the enemy was forced to retreat. On the battlefield as well as strategically they excelled at hit and run tactics.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SLAVE_REVOLT, "The Slave Revolt led by the Thracian gladiator Spartacus from 73 to 71 BC was the third in a series of major slave revolts that had to be put down by military force in the later Roman Republic. The revolt started when 200 gladiators escaped from the gladiator school of Lentulus Batiatus in Capua. Equipping themselves with gladiatorial armour and weapons, they defeated the initial force sent after them and thus acquired more weapons and armour. This pattern repeated itself as the slave army increased to about 120,000 men, women and children. When eventually they were defeated, the Romans exacted a horrible revenge - the 6,000 who were not killed on the battlefield were crucified along the Appian Way from Rome to Capua.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SPANISH, "Ancient Spanish armies were relatively lightly equipped, in keeping with the terrain of their country. The weaponry of their infantry was similar to that of the Romans, a heavy throwing spear and short stabbing sword, but they lacked armour. They also had many light javelinmen, and light and heavier horsemen. Some of the tribes, termed Celtiberians, were of Celtic origin and fought in a style more similar to the Gauls. ",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SR_BRITISH, "This list covers British armies from the departure of Constantine III's field army until 476 AD. The composition of Sub-Roman British armies is largely conjectural.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_SYRACUSAN, "The Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily was a colony of Corinth. Under the rule of a series of tyrants, Syracuse contested with Carthage for control of the island, and even brought the war to North Africa. However, during the Second Punic War, Syracuse switched sides following the Carthaginian victory over the Romans at Cannae. This was a mistake, and led to the conquest of the city by the Romans. The Syracusan army mostly consisted of Greek hoplites, supplemented by various mercenaries.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_THESSALIAN, "The city states of Thessaly in Northern Greece enjoyed a brief period of relative organisation and nascent power under the leadership of the tyrants of Pherae, particularly Jayson of Pherae, who ruled from circa 380 to 370 BC. Phillip II of Macedon overthrew Jayson's sons in 352 BC. Thessalian armies were renowned for the quality and quantity of their cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_THRACIAN, "The Thracians, living in a large area of south-eastern Europe, spent much of their time fighting among themselves. Parts of Thrace intermittently came under rule by the Persians, then the Macedonians and finally the Romans. In the Hellenistic period many of their foot were armed with the dreaded two-handed rhomphaia, a curved blade with the cutting edge on the inside of the curve, on the end of a long handle. This was capable of lopping off limbs. They also had many light cavalry with javelins or bow, and a few armoured noble cavalry.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_UMBRIAN, "Umbria was an area of central Italy between the Romans, Latins and Etruscans. It was conquered by the Romans between 310 and 260 BC. Umbrian armies probably consisted mainly of javelin-armed foot with some hoplites.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_WESTERN_HUNNIC, "The westward advance of the fierce nomadic Huns across the steppe provoked the barbarian migrations that made such a major contribution to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Under Attila, who ruled the Huns from 434 AD until his death in 453, they conquered a mighty empire, including the Ostrogoths, Gepids and many other Germanic tribes amongst their vassals and raiding in force as far as Rome. Following the death of Attila, however, their vassals successfully rebelled and the Huns sank back into obscurity. The Huns fought exclusively as horse archers, though their vassals supplied Germanic lancers, foot warbands and archers.",
IDS_ARMY_INTRO_WEST_GREEK, "The scanty evidence suggests that the Greeks of Sicily, Massilia and other Western Mediterranean colonies continued to use the hoplite phalanx long after it was obsolete in mainland Greece.",
